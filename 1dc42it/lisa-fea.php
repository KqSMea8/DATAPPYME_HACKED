Abstract— This paper entails the design and finite element analysis (FEA) of a LPG cylinder made of E-glass fiber, vinyl- ester resin and HDPE plastic composite The liner of the cylinder is made of HDPE plastic (blow moulding grade) and wound Abstract— This study deals with the finite element analysis of the monotonic behavior of reinforced concrete beams, slabs and beam-column joint sub assemblages.  Finite Element Analysis or FEA, is a form of structure analysis.  These computer simulations work by taking larger, very complex geometry and breaks it up into thousands of tiny, simple parts that interact together (A good analogy of this is a Lego structure, where a complex object is actually comprised of many smaller, simple parts). 3.

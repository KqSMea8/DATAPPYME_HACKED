Outline of architecture options in the light of 5G and “acceleration” discussion Two radio technologies have to be considered in the 5G discussions first 5g nr specs approved.  5G NR is not only going to be the wireless front end of a converged network and data center architecture, the goal is to make the radio access network (RAN) of 5G NR more open and flexible, while supporting existing functions. December 22, 2017.  Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access. The 5G architecture is defined as service-based and the interaction between network functions is represented in two ways.  5G NR QoS Architecture; 5G NR Security; Self-Optimization (SoN) and Self-Configuration .  To support optimal performance for a wide variety of services, and to do so cost-effectively for operators, 5G NR will be deployed within an entirely new network architecture.  It covers 5G NR MAC functions, 5G NR MAC architecture, 5G NR MAC channel mapping, 5G NR MAC procedures and format of 5G NR MAC header and subheaders.  2017.  5G Spectrum 3GPP 5G (NR) Use Case Development and Operator Views 5G RAN Standards Update 2 5G Use cases and services Florian Kaltenberger renamed 5G-NR (from 5G-NR (gNB)) architecture document for NR FAPI: collect what we have to present to SCF.

An abnormal EKG is usually classified as such due to a slow or fast heart rate, or an irregular beat.  Three general categories of P wave changes will be described, including those reflecting abnormal sites or patterns of activation, those caused by left atrial abnormalities, and those Electrocardiography (ECG) is the main diagnostic procedure for detecting arrhythmias and determining their cause. Abnormal EKG waves signify problems in the conduction and can be used to diagnose various heart conditions.

<strong> A new roadmap has been shown there, revealing the codenames of upcoming Zen2 and Zen3 processors.  Navi is shown on AMD’s roadmap for 2019, though we have few details other than the focus is on scalability and it will be the last GCN iteration.  AMD has outlined its GPU roadmap through to 2020, teasing its Navi architecture which will be manufactured on the 7nm fabrication process.  This is followed by the cleverly named NEXT-GEN on 7nm+ in 2020 which should bring, wait for it, NEXT–GEN features.  AMD could have stopped with a simple tease of the Ryzen 2, but carried on by showing off its roadmap going into 2020. amd enterprise cpu roadmap 20152019 leaked features 14nm naples with 32 cores and 7nm starship with 48 cores there are a total of 9 cpu products that the roadmap mentions, amd zen enterprise roadmap leaked 14nm 32core naples cpu 7nm 48core starship cpu we have the amd starship cpu that features 48 zen 2 cores this means that it will be better AMD to skip 12nm FF in favor of 7nm Vega in 2018, Navi planned for 2019 followed by “Next-Gen” on 7nm+ in 2020 Previous AMD roadmaps confirmed Vega on a ’14nm+’ process node.  Unluckily, there are no additional details about these processors apart from that this group will also fall in inside the optimization phase.  That seems rather early for AMD to bring about the replacements for a processor range that has done rather well for them. Die dritte Generation der Threadripper-CPUs soll auf den Namen Castle Peak h&#246;ren.  Succeeding this years launch is Threadripper 2nd Gen, also to be famous as Ryzen Threadripper 2000 series.  Loading Close.  AMD hosted their Raven Ridge APU event before CES 2018, with a few teases of their GPU architecture roadmap that teases a Vega refresh on the newly-used 7nm node in 2018.  As revealed above, thanks to the AMD roadmap and Thurrott.  AMD CPU And GPU Roadmaps For 2015-2020 Officially Emerge Hardware 6 hours ago by Khalid Moammer AMD shared its 5 year long GPU and APU roadmap with the world for the first time during the PC Cluster Consortium event in Osaka Japan.  MAIN EVENT The main event held on January 9-12, 2018 at CES, Las Vegas.  According to a new report from WCCFtech, citing &quot;sources familiar with the entire situation,&quot; Sony&#39;s PlayStation 5 (PS5 for short) will launch in 2020 and be powered by AMD&#39;s Navi GPU chip.  The analyst expects AMD to see strong performance gains in EPYC 2 at a time when Intel&#39;s roadmap is facing challenges, with its 10nm server product expected in mid-2020 at best.  the PS5 to be precise,&quot; the report claims before explaining that AMD's roadmap for Navi is dependent on Sony.  The Vega 64 and Vega 56 parts are both premium-priced cards, and, at least for the foreseeable future, they're going to be AMD's only Vega desktop chips.  Never mind AMD’s comeback, Intel’s 2018 kicked off with its biggest embarrassments to date: Meltdown and Spectre.  AMD&#39;s second-generation 7nm Epyc server chips, codenamed Rome, are due to arrive in volume that year, too, by the way. Dali subsequently joins AMD's &quot;Renoir&quot; APU and &quot;Vermeer&quot; CPUs (each anticipated within the 7 nm course of) for AMD's 2020 roadmap. AMD look like they will continue to dominate with their Ryzen AM4 platform in 2019.  The AMD roadmap shows that by 2020 the AMD Zen3 architecture will be released but keeping mind the longevity of the roadmap, it is more than likely that there will be a Zen5 as well.  MIGHT make it through 2020 if there is a Zen 2+, depending on if AMD feels like their promise to support AM4 through Zen2 includes Zen2+.  AMD menyiapkan roadmap agar prosesor x86 berbasis 7 nanometer itu dapat dirilis pada 2020 mendatang.  We can see that Navi is AMD 2020 Roadmap leaked in the internet. In AMD’s product roadmap, both its upcoming Navi GPU and Zen 2 CPU will be based on 7nm FinFETs.  AMD to skip 12nm FF in favor of 7nm Vega in 2018, Navi planned for 2019 followed by “Next-Gen” on 7nm+ in 2020 Previous AMD roadmaps confirmed Vega on a ’14nm+’ process node.  Intel just uses lower end server chip as the HEDT chip, and AMD uses single die version as theirs(as opposed to 4 on server).  From the first look it seems that 2nd Generation Ryzen Threadripper will be succeeded next year by Castle Peak architecture, based on Zen2.  It continues outlining AMD’s roadmap for Navi.  Each year will also see the launch of a new Threadripper Next-Gen High End AMD has revealed its CPU and GPU roadmaps for the upcoming five years, during a press conference at the PC Cluster Consortium event in Japan.  And then it had to Dali subsequently joins AMD’s “Renoir” APU and “Vermeer” CPUs (each anticipated within the 7 nm course of) for AMD’s 2020 roadmap.  4 . ศ.  AMD&#39;s 2020 Product Roadmap! For AMD’s first 7nm server household particularly, AMD made assumptions round Intel’s roadmap and what they might do in the event that they had been Intel.  Banyak informasi hadir bukan hanya terkait dengan Ryzen 2 saja, tetapi juga mengenai roadmap AMD untuk produk mereka yang akan hadir pada tahun 2020.  The details are very limited but emerge a future scenario that comes up when the solutions expected for 2020 This roadmap reveals some bad news for Intel, that the company will not be shipping any 10nm Xeon Processors until Q1 or Q2 2020, around a year after AMD's release of 7nm, which is roughly equivalent to Intel's 10nm, Zen 2-based EPYC 2 processors, giving AMD a significant advantage in 2019 thanks to their use of advanced process technologies.  AMD released a new Roadmap which shows codenames of upcoming Zen2 and Zen3 processors.  Leaks about AMD’s upcoming Ryzen Threadripper has surfaced all over the wire.

Those plans, however, will be extended to the PC gaming space to compete with the duopoly of Nvidia and AMD by the year 2020.

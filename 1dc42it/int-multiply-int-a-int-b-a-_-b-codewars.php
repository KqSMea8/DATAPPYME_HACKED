A) mass is demoted to an int, units remains an int, and the result of mass * units is an int .  the arr is a pointer to a resizable array class(get and set are members of that class).  Hence, c is the largest integer that divides both a and b means c is also the largest integer that divides both −a and b.  There will always be only one integer that appears an odd number of times.  The program should ask the user for two numbers, then call the function with the numbers as arguments, and tell the user the sum. Saw your question was already answered, so this might be a little extraneous but .  This is actually quite easy as I'll show you.  It holds a numerical representation of the symbol (ASCII code). This program is a good demonstration of 2 dimensional arrays in Java. The expression a*b is float, which gets converted to double.  Tavcom 04h.

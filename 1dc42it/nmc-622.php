A number of Targray Cathode active materials, including our Nickel Manganese Cobalt (NMC622, NMC811, NMC532), Lithium Manganese Spinel (LMO), and Lithium Nickel Manganese Spinel (LNMO) formulas, have been used by the US-based Argonne National Laboratory to achieve exceptional energy efficiency in lab tests.  C.  Lower consumption of cobalt per kilowatt hour (kWh) will cut the material costs of a battery Current NMC ternary lithium-ion batteries from South Korean and Japanese makers typically employ a ratio of 60% nickel to 20% manganese, and 20% cobalt (6:2:2), but as that ratio moves to 8:1:1 in 2018 and beyond, the cathode is a key element in achieve vast cost efficiencies. 1 Co 0. 8 Mn 0.

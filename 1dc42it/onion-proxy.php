New to TOR, looking to set up a proxy because I&#39;m paranoid.  the onion proxy blindly relays data back and forth between the application proxy and the onion routing network (and thus the exit funnel at the other end of the anonymous connection).  onion link for browsing Wikileaks is currently unavailable; however, if you have installed Tor and are redirecting all of your browsing through the Tor network, you can still browse the normal WikiLeaks site with a high degree of anonymity (but not end-to-end encryption).  active.  Anyone who tries to trace would see traffic coming from random nodes on the Tor network, rather than the user&#39;s computer.  It can be reinstated by reapplying the create edit (see the Edit History)</p>

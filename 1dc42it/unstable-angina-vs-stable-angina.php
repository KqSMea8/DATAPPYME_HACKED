It lasts longer than stable angina and isn&#39;t relieved with rest or medicine.  Angina that occurs during or after physical exercise or emotional stress is referred to as stable because of the predictable pattern of heart pain caused by exertion or stress.  The clinical picture is often defined as stable angina or chronic angina .  It can be difficult to distinguish unstable angina from non-ST elevation (non-Q wave) myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).  &quot;Angina that is predictable, appears with stress, exertion, eating or coitus and is relieved with rest or with the anti-angina medications nitrates is called stable angina.

Additional treatment is needed beyond taking these 2 Angina comes from pain resulting from a lack if oxygen from poor blood flow to the heart muscle mostly due to blocked arteries although arterial spasms are also a possibility.  The goal of this prospective study was to identify lesion morphological features leading to presentation of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) vs non-STEMI (NSTEMI) or unstable angina pectoris vs stable coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients undergoing PCI using a drug-eluting stent (N = 8582).  PCI for Stable CAD, Other Indications All Drop.  It lasts longer than stable angina and isn't relieved with rest or medicine.

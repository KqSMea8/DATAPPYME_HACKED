The ESP32 is very popular among makers as the brains for various projects.  The maximum volume level of the MP3 shield is 30.  Ultra Low Power Solution ESP32’s ultra low power consumption radio architecture and proprietary power save technologies extend battery life in real-world applications, using the following features: •fine granularity clock-gating, •multiple low-power modes, and &lt;speed&gt; The speed of the serial link in bits per second.  This feature will prevent some i Product Description.  1 of esptool does not know about ESP32-PICO-D4, but it can still detect an ESP32 device, and the update went through normally.  The ESP32 series employs a Tensilica Xtensa LX6 microprocessor in both dual-core and single-core variations and includes in-built antenna switches, RF balun, power amplifier, low-noise receive amplifier, filters, and power-management modules.  The ESP32 D2WD is a 5 mm x 5 mm QFN48 package, 69% as large as the standard 6 mm x 6 mm QFN48 ESP32.

The LoRaWan network makes it possible to connect objects (sensors, actuators) or machines without going through a local WiFi network, ADSL or fiber.  The Wemos D1 R32 is an Arduino Uno form factor ESP32 dev board.  Sketches to support the YouTube video</h3>

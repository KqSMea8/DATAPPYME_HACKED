Introduction and Aims: roxadustat (FG−4592/ASP1517) is a hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor, which is currently in phase III development for the treatment of anaemia associated with chronic kidney disease.  Vadadustat, also known as AKB-6548, is a novel, titratable, oral HIF-PH inhibitor in development for the treatment of anemia in both nondialysis-dependent (NDD) and dialysis- Primary endpoint. Anemia is 66% and 84% more likely to develop among patients in the 3rd and 4th quartiles of serum fibroblast growth factor 23 level vs those in the 1st quartile.

When oxygen levels are too low (hypoxia), blood flow has to be increased, metabolism reduced, or a combination of both, to counteract tissue damage.  3 mg/kg vs 4.  Roxadustat is a chemical drug and thus has the potential of being cheaper than traditional ESAs.

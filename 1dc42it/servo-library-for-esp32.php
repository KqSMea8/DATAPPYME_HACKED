So far Bluetooth and AnalogWrite() are not yet implemented in the Arduino Library, but PWM is pretty easy using ledcWrite() and its associated functions.  The powerful motor is PWM controlled for easy interfacing.  but how can I let the servo move if I rotate the sensor around its z axis, for example, put the sensor on the table, and then just rotate it, the servo will move as well.  It has many features of the state-of-the-art low power chips, including fine resolution clock gating, power modes, and dynamic power scaling.  The goal implemented by the code is simple, turn the servo motors in a different direction using different angles to demonstrate its capabilities.  For example, if value is HIGH, pulseIn() waits for the pin to go from LOW to HIGH, starts timing, then waits for the pin to go LOW and stops timing.  You’re an impatient coder.  akbarhash.  Q.

Unlike mining, seismic survey is not about breaking rock, it is about generating a seismic wave through the detonation of an explosive charge at a specified depth.  The multi client’s surveys will provides the opportunity to oil and gas companies to share the costs of exploration projects.  Data acquisition, processing, and interpretation are the three phases of seismic survey.  Q: What is a seismic survey? A. The results of a seismic survey may be presented in the form of a cross-sectional drawing of the subsurface structures as if cut by a plane through the shot point, the detector, and Earth’s centre.  of the seismic survey, Licensee shall make another video showing the condition of the City streets, roads, and other City owned property along the same route.  Geophysical surveys are classified as seismic and non-seismic and provide various levels of detail, but all generate useful data based on the purposes for which the surveys are conducted.  Seismic surveys are conducted by sending a seismic wave, generated by an energy source, into the subsurface of the earth and recording the reflection wave back on the earth’s surface. Seismic surveys Explorers use seismic surveys to produce detailed images of local geology to determine the location and size of possible oil and gas reservoirs.  Whilst on the crew, acquired data is insured via a “business interruption and data reinstatement” insurance policy.  5 Data format and quality control (QC) 1.  To carry out such surveys, ships tow multiple airgun arrays that emit thousands of high-decibel explosive impulses to map the seafloor.

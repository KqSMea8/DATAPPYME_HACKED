Hello, for my final university exam I am trying to use SNPE with Tiny YOLO for real time object detection in an Android App.  To the best of our knowledge, our method, called Quantization Mimic, is the ﬁrst one focusing on very tiny networks.  To solve this problem we will train YOLO v3 - state-of-the-art instance segmentation model.  That should get you the NCS ready model.  Other than the sizeYOLO v3 is much more precise than previous versions, and despite being a bit slower, it remains one of the fastest algorithms around.  The tiny YOLO v1 is consist of 9 convolution layers and 3 full connected layers.  Regardless how YOLO requires the labeling of training data&nbsp;darknet yolo train cfg/yolo.

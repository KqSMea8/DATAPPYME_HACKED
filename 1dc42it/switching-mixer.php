In this article, a new low voltage folded-switching mixer with current reuse, which operates at 1 V supply voltage, is discussed.  Some mixers use &#39;soft switching&#39; to ensure that there are no clicks or pops no matter when the signal is switched - this usually involves using FETs as switching devices.  ECE145B/ECE218B Mixer Lectures switching mixer mode is preferred because it generates fewer spurs.  A quadrature switching mixer is provided for mixing a received RF signal and a local oscillator signal, while rejecting an image signal associated with the RF signal.  Single balanced switching mixer output voltage spectrum Apart from sum and difference components due to mixing action, LO feedthrough still exists which is due to DC component in RF signal.  com/roland-v-1hd The AT-MX351a SmartMixer® is a microprocessor controlled, automatic switching, five-channel mixer.

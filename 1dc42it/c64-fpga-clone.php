Till Harbaum’s “MiST” is a FPGA-motherboard which is to emulate different home computers or arcade automats with the help of different “cores”.  (NOTE: I had issues getting this clone recognized on my Mac, due to it using a different serial chip.  77MHz with an IBM CGA card and PC Speaker sound.  It is implemented (programmed) in VHDL, a hardware description language designed for high-density logic chips (like FPGAs).  You&#39;d be surprised.  Please forgive the dodgy coding as this was a work in progress and also my first verilog/vhdl coding experience. Nov 09, 2018&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;I pretty much had to as someone who used a Commodore 64 regularly throughout their childhood, and into their teens.  just a clone which you need some copyrighted firmware when you can make a new 65c816 CPU accelerator that could be better.  Also with the chip they are using (the Spartan FPGA) they are simulating the Z80 arch. Conceptually it resembles my earlier ZX81 clone but when finished it will be a capable Z80 based 128K full color home computer, able to drive a VGA monitor in high resolution, and with 64 colors, it has sound, (BBC) BASIC and an SD-card for storage.

Our affordable products are the answer to the problem of a noisy car, truck, or anything with an engine compartment.  The viscoelastic principle is isothermal adiabatic.  There are several ways in which a material can absorb sound.  I didn&#39;t weigh the difference, but my guess is that the removal of the huge sound deadening pad in the back along with the old carpet couldn&#39;t get anywhere close to the weight of the little bit of dynamat I used along with the lighter weight carpet.  The principle is that a solid structure can intercept sound waves and reduce the noise level in the shadow it casts.  Secondly, our product is is made of stone, meaning its non-combustible and fire resistant.  NoiseStop Systems offers a range of products to soundproof walls in your office or home. 3.  High-density foam is especially bad for low frequency sounds.  This has to do with features like a fabric’s quality and thickness.  For best results, cover the walls entirely.  Sound waves can be minimized through creation of space, insulation, absorption, and lessening the rigidity of a surface.  Sound deadening materials are products used to reduce the rattling in the body panels and license plates of a vehicle.  Once you have your inner walls in place you should be careful to fill any gaps using a suitable sealant before adding acoustic baffling.  Acoustiblok is made of a proprietary viscoelastic polymer material with a high density mineral content.  You could apply a sound-deadening membrane, called mass-loaded vinyl, over the studs before hanging the drywall, but these sheets are costly.  The density of the material helps to deaden sounds and foot traffic noise</p>

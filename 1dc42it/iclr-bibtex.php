My research interests include object detection, semantic segmentation in images and videos.  Members of the IclR family of regulators are proteins with around 250 residues.  I am interested in building machines that understand the stories that videos portray, and, inversely, in using videos to teach machines about the world.  Sontag, S.

Controlling musculoskeletal systems, especially robots actuated by pneumatic artificial muscles, is a challenging task due to nonlinearities, hysteresis effects, massive actuator de- lay and unobservable dependencies such as temperature.

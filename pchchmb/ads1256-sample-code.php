I am fairly new to the microcontroller world having taken one class way back in college on it.  2.  The filter has the advantage of being sequential – it needs only the system variables of the previous sample and the forcing terms and observations of the current sample.  This can be used for a brain-computer interface with biofeedback using a flex sensor or servo to detect fingure movements.  This is far below the 200,000 samples per second claimed by the MCP3002 datasheet, and not even enough for decent audio, let alone ultrasonics!24-Bit Multifunction Temperature &amp; Voltage Devices The USB-2416 Series offers high-resolution voltage or thermocouple measurements along with digital I/O.

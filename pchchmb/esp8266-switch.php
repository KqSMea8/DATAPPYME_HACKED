We have been maintaining our quick shipping service since we started the store in Turku, Finland(in 2012).  A generic multi-purpose sketch built on top of the CoogleIOT platform to control an arbitrary number of switches via GPIO pins on an ESP8266 using MQTT.  All the lua scripts mentioned above can be downloaded here: ESP8266-wlan-switch It is important to understand that the ssid and the password of the WLAN are saved in clear text on the ESP8266.  lua scripts both need to change in order to make this happen. Adafruit Industries, Unique &amp; fun DIY electronics and kits Magnetic contact switch (door sensor) ID: 375 - This sensor is essentially a reed switch, encased in an ABS plastic shell.  This page shows how to get the most out the limited pins available on the ESP8266-01.  If you want to run the Espruino Firmware directly on an ESP8266 board, see this page instead The ESP8266 can sink about 12 mA and source about 20 mA.  Using an AT command set, any microcontroller with a UART can use the ESP8266 This tutorial is an improved version of the ESP8266 Internet-connected switch. May 02, 2016&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Simple switch read using ESP8266 Apr 29, 2016, 07:35 am Is there an example of using the ESP8266 in a stand alone mode in the Arduino IDE but not involving an Arduino module to simply read a switch state using an IPAD or similar device.  It needs 5V DC to operate.  This tutorial is improved version of ESP8266 internet connected switch. Aug 25, 2015&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;- Tue Aug 25, 2015 5:05 pm #27018 Not to be impolite, but Routers are irrelevant in the proposed scenario, what you are looking for is a Switch.  3v device Lots of info on the ESP8266 modules The sample programs with the SDK are an AT command processor and an IoT demo which can be configured as a remote switch, RGB ESP8266 WiFi Connection manager with fallback web configuration portal WifiLocation Library to get geographic position (lat, lon, accuracy), without GPS, by listening surrounding WiFi networks (Works with ESP8266 and WiFi101 boards, including MKR1000) Which is the fastest Arduino - ESP32, ESP8266, Arduino Uno, Arduino 101 +Others Speed Test Comparison Chart Ubiquiti EdgeRouter Lite ERLite-3 - Internal USB Storage Failure DIY gigabit POE network switch - Works with Ubiquiti 24V passive gigabit POE devices Java software, ESP8266 software, FPGA configurations, a 3D-printed design, and PCB layouts.  lua&quot;), then enter node.

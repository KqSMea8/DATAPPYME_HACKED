Capjack.  Townes, James P.  The goal was to produce a system that can engage It is no coincidence that laser action was first produced in the microwave region : Spontaneous emission is proportional to the cube of the transition frequency, it is extremely small in this part of the spectrum and can be neglected compared to other important processes such as stimulated emission and absorption.  When an intruder enters the detection zone, changes to the field are registered and an alarm occurs.  The energy is used to heat the inside of the prostate.  The intense laser beam heats up the air and thus reduces its coefficient of refraction.  giove-a precise orbit determination from microwave and satellite laser ranging data - first perspectives for the galileo constellation and its scientific use from two free-running laser sources would generate a microwave or mm-wave signal with high phase noise since the phase terms of the two optical waves are not I understand Microwave is cheaper but my concern is if somebody else in between the two buildings starts there own wan on the same freq this might interfere.

MASER stands for Microwave Amplification by Stimulation Emission of Radiation.  In fact, the first laser that was assembled in 1954 using a source of microwaves to energize or stimulate the electrons in a cloud of ammonia and form a coherent beam of light.  The Rayleigh criterion dictates that any radio wave, microwave or laser beam will spread and become weaker and diffuse over distance; the larger the transmitter antenna or laser aperture compared to the wavelength of radiation, the tighter the Such an intercept is very tricky, because a radar and fire control system would have to detect, track, and fire a microwave or laser beam against an incoming artillery round long enough to cause a EMCORE Corporation has a long history of supplying the U.  Credit: Jared Sisler/Harvard University Wi-Fi and an acronym for Microwave Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation; a device that produces an extremely intense, small and nearly nondivergent beam of monochromatic radiation in the microwave region, with all the waves in phase.  An attosecond is a quintillionth of a second, or a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a second.  」 「There was a publication where interference between two higher frequency signals (I think about 20 Khz) was used to create a low frequecy signal inside the body for medical purposes.

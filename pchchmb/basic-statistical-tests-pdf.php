In some com-munities, such as in bioinformatics, R already is the primary workhorse for statistical analyses.  In statistical hypothesis testing we use a p-value (probability value) to decide whether or not the sample provides strong evidence against the null hypothesis.  If more than one measurement is made on each observation, multivariate analysis is applied. 05, Spring 2014 Note: This is a set of practice problems for exam 1.  Basics of Statistical Hypothesis Tests 1 Statistical hypothesis testing involves using a sample test statistic to decide which of two competing claims to reject or fail to reject.  Stratification variables should be used in the statistical analysis.

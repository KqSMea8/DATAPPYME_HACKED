Bryant1 ABSTRACT Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is a geophysical imaging technique used for subsurface exploration and monitoring.  GPR is used for finding and detecting buried object.  In this chapter, two of the major challenges in the application of ground‐penetrating radar in humanitarian demining operations are addressed: (i) development and testing of affordable and practical ground penetrating radar (GPR)‐based systems, which can be used off‐ground and (ii) development What is a Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR)? GPR is based on “stacking” a series of ultra-wide band electromagnetic pulse emissions that are sent directly into the subsurface.  Ideal for outfitting fleets, the LMX100 is tailored for the locate-and-mark needs of utility locating.  Deep ground penetrating radar underground scanning surveys are conducted with a low frequency GPR antenna, such as a 200-MHz antenna that can reach depths of up to 35 feet in sandy soils.  In addition, due to the attenuation of signals by the earth, there is less interference with a sensitive buried low cost.  of them is ground-penetrating radar (GPR), perhaps the mostadvanced new technology, which can detect both metallic and plastic mines in a variety of soils by non-invasive subsurface sensing [Bruschini et al.  Our mission is to provide a accurate and low cost service with a quick turn-around time.  Investigating the ground before digging a foundation can take months of surveying, which costs time, money and the patience of those who live near the construction site.  J. , 13 June 2014.  Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) has emerged in the last 30 years as the leading geophysical technique for unmarked grave detection.  Ground penetrating radar (GPR) produces an underground cross-sectional image of the soils and subsurface features.  This is a touchy subject.  MARRSI can provide detailed information on the subsurface and geological context for surface meas-urements and sample collection.  Synthetic Aperture RADAR (“SAR”), uses mathematical techniques, to combine reflected signal phase and amplitude information, as a function of time, from several adjacent-in-time RADAR pulses to build up (“synthesise”) a high resolution image, matching the quality achievable from a much larger antenna, without any additional mathematical manipulation.

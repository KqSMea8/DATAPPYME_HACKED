For a long time, that was fine, that was enough; that was all I needed.  SessionKey = HMAC_SHA256(TempKey, &quot;mesg&quot;) With Ratchet this_device being the private part of the newly derived key-pair.  Bcrypt, which is based on the Blowfish cipher and includes a salt, is designed to protect against brute-force attacks by intentionally being slower to operate. g.  He is B.  The data generated in steps 2 and 3 is then used as input to the PBKDF2 (Password-based Key Derivation Function 2) function with 100 1000 (new since 2016) iterations of HMAC-SHA256. .  The hashing of a given data creates a fingerprint that makes it possible to identify the initial data with a high probability (very useful in computer science and cryptography). My theory on this is simple: if SHA256 is &quot;broken,&quot; it will very likely not &quot;break&quot; double-SHA256.  Each entry is the double-SHA-256 of the 64-byte concatenation of the corresponding two hashes below it in the tree.  The hash you get will be the reverse of what is displayed in a block explorer though, meaning the displayed hash is the “wrong way round”.  Preventing side-channel attacks (i.

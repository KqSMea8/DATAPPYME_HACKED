The solution is ok, but there is still space for improvement.  I have some sparse data and want to plot them as markers connected by a smooth, interpolated line - like the default behaviour of Microsoft Excel.  I smooth my data, use findpeaks and fit an exponential curve on to the solutions.  I experimented with a few filters of yours and found the smooth noise-robust estimator with n=4, N=7 to be satisfactory.  Line smoothing (aka anti-aliasing) works by inserting semi-transparent pixels at the edges of the actual plot line, thereby giving an optical illusion of a smooth line without pixelization effects. Use the smooth function to smooth response data, using methods for moving average, Savitzky-Golay filters, and local regression with and without weights and&nbsp;This MATLAB function returns a moving average of the elements of a vector using a fixed window length that is determined heuristically.

HISAT2 is a fast and sensitive alignment program for mapping next-generation sequencing reads (whole-genome, transcriptome, and exome sequencing data) to a population of human genomes (as well as to a single reference genome).  (previous page) () The reason :{&gt;By adding your new HISAT2 directory to your PATH environment variable, you ensure that whenever you run hisat2, hisat2-build or hisat2-inspect from the command line, you will get the version you just installed without having to specify the entire path.  MultiQC doesn't run other tools for you - it's designed to be placed at the end of analysis pipelines or to be run manually when you've finished running your tools.  The first step in using HISAT2 is to create index files for your genome assembly: % hisat2-build assembly. fa is the assembly file, and myindex is the prefix you want to give to the index file names.  This requires an existing index which may be created using hisat2 itself.  .  It&#39;s widely used to build languages, tools, and frameworks.  First you must make an index of the genome sequence; this allows the HISAT2 algorithm to rapidly find regions of the genome where each read might align. fa myindex where assembly.  I used only standard genome index from HISAT2 website.  Repeat Steps 6–10 from the host-specific protocol above.  In eukaryotes, the SAM file was generated using HISAT2 program.

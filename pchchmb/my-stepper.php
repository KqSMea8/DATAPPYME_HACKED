A look at a stepper (aka &#39;mini stepper&#39;).  For practical purposes, a stepper motor is a bit like a servo: you can tell it to move to a pre-defined position and can count on getting fairly consistent results with multiple repetitions.  For phase current, you can estimate based on motors of similar design and similar phase resistance.  It&#39;s a good solution to applications that with special space but need low speed and/or high torque.  The Pololu stepper driver chips may overheat and eventually fry the chip losing the ability to switch directions reliably.  Stair Stepper.  8 Deg Nema 17.  50 step step by homework help.

Two challenging problems exist in the CHB-based STATCOM.  The parameters implemented in this simulation are source voltage of l kv, 50 hz AC s upply, DC bus capacitance 10000 e-6 F, Inverter series inductance 3mH, In this proposed model we are doing the in-depth analysis of a single phase H-Bridge inverter using various types of sinusoidal pulse width modulation.  In the Fig.  1).  An m level cascaded H-bridge multilevel inverter needs 2(m-1) switching devices where m is the number of the output voltage level</b></p>

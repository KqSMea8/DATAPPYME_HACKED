DISTILLATION Distillation is a process in which a liquid or vapour mixture of two or more substances is separated into its component fractions of desired purity, by theapplication and removal of heat.  At 78°C the liquid in the flask started to boil and the vapor entered the condenser.  The result is a very open honeycomb structure with inclined flow channels giving a relatively high surface area but with very low resistance to gas flow.  In simple words, the working principle of distillation is to heat a mixture at a specific temperature, collect the hot vapors, and condense to separate the component substance.

Download Distillation Powerpoint Template: Get Powerpoint Template on Distillation.  As a mixture is heated, the liquid with the lowest boiling point will boil and turn into vapor, leaving behind any solid material or other liquids. Purified water is water that has been mechanically filtered or processed to remove impurities and make it suitable for use.  The boiling points of each component in the mixture determine the order of Distillation is a technique that is used to purify a mixture of liquids or to obtain a boiling point of a pure liquid (in the case of this course).  The respective segments of these lines are between the ladders and 180°.  This is used when two substances have a very similar boiling point.  Distillation of a given component is possible if the vapor has a higher proportion of the given component than the solution Common Distillation Methods Reactive distillation Vacuum distillation Fractional distillation (Most Common method) Reactive distillation Reactive distillation is a process where the chemical reactor is also the still.

Distillation is the process of separating the components or substances from a liquid mixture by using selective boiling and condensation.  In a distillation, liquid is converted to vapor by heating and the vapor is then condensed back to liquid by cooling.  Membrane Distillation (MD) is a thermally-driven separation process, in which only vapour molecules transfer through a microporous hydrophobic membrane.  Simple distillation is used to separate and retain the solvent from a solution eg.  In steam distillation, the distilling pot is infused with steam, which carries the Oil’s vapor into the distilling head and then into the condenser, where the Oil and Water co-condense.  ppt / .  The apparatus for a simple distillation is a sealed system, which means nothing is open to the air, and consists of a heat source, a still pot containing the liquid to be distilled, an air- or water-cooled condensing line, and a vessel for the distillate.  Today HETEROGENEOUS AZEOTROPIC DISTILLATION Heterogeneous azeotropic distillation is a widely practiced process for the dehydration of a wide range of materials including acetic acid, chloroform, ethanol, and many higher alcohols.  Distillation may result in essentially complete separation (nearly pure components), or it may be a partial separation that increases the concentration of selected components in the mixture.  In designing a distillation column, the thermodynamics of the vapor and liquid phases Distillation is a physical process that uses heat to purify or separate mixtures containing one or more liquids.  The driving force in the MD process is the vapour pressure difference induced by the temperature difference across the hydrophobic membrane.  Most readers with chemical engineering backgrounds will be familiar with this material andDistillation of wood is the process in which wood is heated (not burned) to form charcoal and vapors.

This paper provides an in‐depth review for extractive The molecular distillation design is selected for when the distillate is of high boiling point and/or extremely heat sensitive.  the analysis of continuous distillation is the Reflux Ratio, defined as the quantity of liquid returned to the distillation column over the quantity of liquid withdrawn as product from the column, i.  The distillation process of Crude oil is the main concern of this paper.  There are also many others that are not working Extractive distillation – Type of distillation where a solvent is introduced to the mixture which changes the relative volatilities of the other substances, allowing them to be separated through normal distillation methods.  1 • Minimum-boiling azeotropefeed: solvent with lower volatility than the key components added Hydro distillation is a method of extraction, which is sometimes used instead of steam distillation.
